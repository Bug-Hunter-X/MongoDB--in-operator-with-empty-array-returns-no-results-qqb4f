# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with the MongoDB `$in` operator when used with an empty array.  The expected behavior is to return all documents when the array is empty, acting as a no-op. However, MongoDB returns an empty array.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when you use the `$in` operator to query a field with an empty array. Instead of returning all documents, MongoDB returns no results. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application logic.

## Solution
The solution is to avoid passing an empty array to the `$in` operator.  Instead, use a conditional check to handle the case where the array is empty and return all documents or perform an alternative query.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the unexpected result of zero results.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see how to handle empty arrays correctly.
